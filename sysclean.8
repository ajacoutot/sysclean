.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a
.Xr perl 1
script designed to help removing obsolete files between upgrades.
.Pp
.Nm
works by comparing a reference root directory against currently installed files.
It considers standard system files, configuration files installed by default,
and packages files.
.Pp
.Nm
doesn't remove any files on the system.
It only reports obsolete filenames or packages using out-of-date libraries.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Filename mode.
.Nm
will output obsolete filenames present on the system.
By default, it doesn't show filenames used by installed packages.
.It Fl p
Package mode.
.Nm
will output packages names using obsolete files.
.It Fl a
All files.
.Nm
will not exclude filenames used by installed packages from output.
.It Fl i
With ignored.
.Nm
will not exclude filenames normally ignored using
.Pa /etc/sysclean.ignore .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "PKG_DBDIR"
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
The standard package database directory,
.Pa /var/db/pkg ,
can be overridden by specifying an alternative directory in the
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
environment variable.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/sysclean.ignore"
.It Pa /etc/sysclean.ignore
Files to ignore from output.
One per line.
If the filename is a directory,
.Nm
will not explore it, so all files behind will be ignored too.
