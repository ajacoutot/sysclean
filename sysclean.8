.Nm sysclean
.Nd help removing obsolete files between upgrades
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl s | f | a | p
.Op Fl i
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a
.Xr perl 1
script designed to help removing obsolete files between upgrades.
.Pp
.Nm
works by comparing a reference root directory against currently installed files.
It considers standard system files, configuration files installed by default,
and packages files.
.Pp
.Nm
doesn't remove any files on the system.
It only reports obsolete filenames or packages using out-of-date libraries.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s
Safe mode.
.Nm
will output obsolete filenames present on the system.
It excludes any dynamic libraries and all files under
.Pa /etc
directory.
It is the default mode used.
.It Fl f
File mode.
.Nm
will additionnally show old libraries that aren't used by any packages, and
.Pa /etc
will be inspected.
Note that it will report on stderr libraries from base with better version than
expected one.
.It Fl a
All files mode.
.Nm
will not exclude filenames used by installed packages from output.
.It Fl p
Package mode.
.Nm
will output packages names using obsolete files.
.It Fl i
With ignored.
.Nm
will not exclude filenames normally ignored using
.Pa /etc/sysclean.ignore .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "PKG_DBDIR"
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
The standard package database directory,
.Pa /var/db/pkg ,
can be overridden by specifying an alternative directory in the
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
environment variable.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/sysclean.ignore"
.It Pa /etc/sysclean.ignore
Each line of the file contains the name of a path to ignore during filesystem
walk, specified by its absolute pathname, one per line.
Shell globbing is supported in pathnames, see
.Xr File::Glob 3p
for syntax details.
If the pattern matches a directory,
.Nm
will not explore it, all files within will be ignored too.
For compatibility with
.Xr changelist 5
file format, the character
.Sq +
is skipped at the beginning of line.
Additional files can be included with the
.Ic @include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
@include "/etc/changelist"
.Ed
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Obtain the list of outdated files (without used libraries from ports):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# sysclean -f
/usr/lib/libc.so.83.0
.Ed
.Pp
Obtain the list of old libraries with package using it:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# sysclean -p
/usr/lib/libc.so.84.1   git-2.7.0
/usr/lib/libc.so.84.1   gmake-4.1p0
.Ed
.Pp
Obtain the list of all outdated files (including used libraries):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# sysclean -a
/usr/lib/libc.so.83.0
/usr/lib/libc.so.84.1
